This script allows you to insert an icon depending on the type of updates you have made in your code.

If you want to start organizing your commits better and make them visually appealing, you're in the right place. I present you GitComic (Git Commit Icons).

## Why

After a month of trying out VSCode and getting a configuration I'm comfortable with, I've decided to go back to Nvim. 🙃

However, during my time with VSCode, I came across a specific plugin 🔌 that I loved and, after returning to the terminal, I missed it. It's a very simple plugin, but at the same time, I find it very useful, and it adds a different touch 🤩 to your Git repositories.

## Functionality

The plugin allows you to include an icon 😃 in your Git commits that visually describes the changes you've made in your repository, in addition to the comment 📝 you want to add.

For example:

Imagine you've just made changes to your .gitignore file.

``` shell
gitcomic "🙈 Added a file to ignore"
```

Or you're starting a project.

``` shell
gitcomic "🎉 Let's go for it"
```

Perhaps you've just come back from a party and feel like doing some programming.

``` shell
gitcomic "🍺 Not my best night"
```

Or, finally, you manage to pass those darn tests.

``` shell
gitcomic "✅ I'm done"
```

Those emojis aren't chosen randomly, each of them represents the essence of the changes made in that commit.

Here's a list of some more icons you can find.
